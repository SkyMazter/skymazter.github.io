        <p>
          I’m a Full Stack Software Engineer proficient in C++,
          JavaScript/TypeScript, and Swift/UIKit, with experience in both UI
          design and backend development for web and iOS applications. Since
          beginning my coding journey in 2017, I earned a B.A. in Computer
          Science in June 2024 and am currently seeking post-graduate internship
          or career opportunities to grow my portfolio. I’ve contributed to
          server and network configurations, including the deployment of
          community network nodes and portable server programs. For the past
          four years, I’ve also been a dedicated advocate for digital equity in
          underserved NYC communities, working with organizations like CTNY and
          El Puente to create and facilitate community tech labs, workshops, and
          curricula focused on web development, networking, and community
          resilience.
